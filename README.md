# Tech-Blog
This is a blog for our users. The goal was to make a place where users can post articles. Additionally, this turned out to be the toughest assignment weve seen to date. I did not get this done in time. Expect a resubmition after group project 2.
In this assignment I have the framework working, the ability to log in, log out, and sign up. 
I do not have the means to make new posts, post interaction, cookies, or a timer to log out after a set time.
